	<p>Hello World! I made this blog to show off some of the projects I work on. It seems like most places are asking for a website when you apply to them nowadays, so I will use this one. Hopefully this website represents what I have done well. I am going to do my best to have it do that.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I figured that after learning how to be a full stack developer while I was employed at Stanford, I might as well put the knowledge to good use and make a webapp. While I was at Stanford, I programmed a webapp that ran on an Apache server using the Jinja2 template engine, mod_wsgi, and Google's webapp2. That webapp made use of a Postgresql database to store information about zones, vsyses, ip addresses, ports, and users pertaining to Stanford's network. One webapp I programmed routinely updates Stanford's border routers to prevent malicious traffic from being on the Stanford net. Another webapp I wrote allowed project managers to modify the firewall rules on Stanford's network that pertained to the project. Between those two projects I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Postgresql CLI commands, and exaBGP all in the same summer. I am incredibly grateful for the opprotunity I had at Stanford, and the amazing amount of information they taught me about computer networks and systems.</p>
	<br>
	<p>So the first project I am going to display is this webapp. The web page you are looking at now was served to you by an Ubuntu server running apache2 which makes use of mod_wsgi. Django is the web framework I used, which had built in support for Jinja2, and Postgresql (even though I use psycopg2 directly anyway). I originally styled the site with Bootstrap because of a class I had my senior year in college. I have since changed to use w3.css because it is lighter, looks a lot like Bootstrap, and, in my opinion, is simpler.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Using mod_wsgi in daemon mode would make some people say that this is a production grade webserver, and Django with Jinja2 is quite a lot more versatile than typical static pages that use Javascript to appear 'dynamic'. It wasn't too hard to set all this up. All it required was reading documentaion. To give you an idea of how much work it was, or if you would like to do it yourself, follow these steps below.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Get a computer that your willing to leave on 24/7 hooked up to the internet, and install Ubuntu on it. I did this with Ubuntu 16.04.1, but it will probably work on other versions of Ubuntu. Read how to install Ubuntu 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation">here.</a>
		</li>
		<li>Make sure it is connected to the internet</li>
		<li>Ensure Python is installed. I did it with Python 3, but I know 2.7 is able to do it because that is the version of Python the Stanford servers used. I am pretty sure Ubuntu comes with python already installed. You can check by typing 
			<br>
			<br>
			<code class="w3-code w3-margin">python --version</code> 
			<br>
			<br>
			on the command line. If it has a number denoting a version, then python is installed. If not, you can install it on the command line with 
			<br>
			<br>
			<code class="w3-code w3-margin">sudo apt-get install python3</code>
			<br>
			<br>
		</li>
